How To Set Up a Ruby on Rails Project with a React Frontend

To follow this tutorial, you need to have the following:

Node.js and npm installed on your development machine. This tutorial uses Node.js version 10.16.0 and npm version 6.9.0. Node.js is a JavaScript run-time environment that allows you to run your code outside of the browser. It comes with a pre-installed Package Manager called npm, which lets you install and update packages. To install these on macOS or Ubuntu 18.04, follow the steps in How to Install Node.js and Create a Local Development Environment on macOS or the “Installing Using a PPA” section of How To Install Node.js on Ubuntu 18.04.

The Yarn package manager installed on your development machine, which will allow you to download the React framework. This tutorial was tested on version 1.16.0; to install this dependency, follow the official Yarn installation guide.

Installation of the Ruby on Rails framework. To get this, follow our guide on How to Install Ruby on Rails with rbenv on Ubuntu 18.04, or How To Install Ruby on Rails with rbenv on CentOS 7. If you would like to develop this application on macOS, please see this tutorial on How To Install Ruby on Rails with rbenv on macOS. This tutorial was tested on version 2.6.3 of Ruby and version 5.2.3 of Rails, so make sure to specify these versions during the installation process.

Installation of PostgreSQL, as shown in Steps 1 and 2 of our tutorial How To Use PostgreSQL with Your Ruby on Rails Application on Ubuntu 18.04 or How To Use PostgreSQL with Your Ruby on Rails Application on macOS. To follow this tutorial, use PostgreSQL version 10. If you are looking to develop this application on a different distribution of Linux or on another OS, see the official PostgreSQL downloads page. For more information on how to use PostgreSQL, see our How To Install and Use PostgreSQL tutorials.
